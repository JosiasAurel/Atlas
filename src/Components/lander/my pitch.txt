A pitch presented by Zenith on the 21 of june 2021 on the aim of sponsorship for internet connection for two weeks

So I aim to work on 5 main things with the internet connection I'll be provided with

1. work on zuri submit all of my assignments
2. finish the atlas website and coming up with a design for the tic center website
3. work on coursera to go to the next step and pluralsight
4. work more on my backend skill cause I've been focusing more on front-end for now
5. I'll be able to learn the skills required to be the assistant tuitor for the bootcamp in the full stack webdevelopment partway

I say today that if I'm been granted the oppurtunity to have this internet connection for these two weeks, I'll be to accomplish all the 5 things mentioned above and if I'll unable to do one I'll will bring fort justifications or report why i was unable

thanks for your keen attention

Zenith.
